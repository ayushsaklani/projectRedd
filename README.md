Diagnosing thoracic diseases using medical imaging is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of anatomy, physiology, and pathology.
While doctors and radiologists continue to hone their skills over years of study and practice, the prospect of develop- ing a consistent and automated technique for disease analysis can be significantly beneficial to the healthcare world and make diagnosis less susceptible to error. Additionally, low-resource hospitals and communities often lack access to the latest medical imaging technology, which further exacerbates the problem. We present REDD: a Real-time Expedited Disease Detection application for Low Resource Countries and settings. Our system allows doctors and health care professionals to simply upload an im- age of chest x-ray scan via a Rasberry Pi4 and receive a segmented output scan of the input image with a diagnosis of the detected thoracic disease with up to 80% confidence score with DICE. REDD addresses the following limitations: Provides the ability for the doctor to upload and receive a diagnosis without the reliance of internet connection and provides a portable solution for remote set- tings with the possibility of instantiating a Cyber-Physical System (CPS).
